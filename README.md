# Really bad osu!mania clone
It doesn't even work!


# Where I'm at
Trying to figure out what each of the values in the `[HitObjects]` section of `.osu` files equate to. So far I reckon
the first 2 indices are key values for mania, and the third is a timestamp of when to place the note relative to the
song's current ms. I don't know what the values after it mean yet.
